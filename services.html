            <div class="info" style="padding-right: 10px;">Dairy farms can play a crucial role in energy conservation through the utilization of biogas systems. Anaerobic digestion of animal waste generates biogas, a renewable energy source composed mainly of methane. This biogas can be used for heating, electricity generation, or as a vehicle fuel.<bR></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By harnessing biogas, dairy farms not only reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal but also contribute to the diversification of energy sources, promoting sustainability within the farm and the broader community.</div>

        <div class="servicesbox">
            <div class="info" style="padding-right: 10px;">Natural manure, derived from the waste produced by dairy farm animals, serves as a valuable resource in sustainable agriculture. The nutrient-rich manure, composed of organic matter, helps enhance soil fertility and structure.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through careful composting and application, dairy farms can minimize the need for synthetic fertilizers, promoting healthier soils and sustainable crop production</div>
